                <h2>Social Circus</h2>
                <p>As the epicenter between two cultural worlds, the Social Circus is a cross-cultural performing arts center focused on 
                    mending language barriers through non-verbal communication, in hopes of building stronger bonds among communities. 
                    <br> <br> Located in Bridgeport, a diverse residential neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, the performing arts center is 
                    incorporated into a master plan for the revitalization of the existing waterfront. Drawing attention to this formerly 
                    overlooked site, the Social Circus invites visitors of all ages and backgrounds to participate in, learn from, and 
                    observe the art of movement. <br><br> Circuses, known for their ability to gather large groups of people for the shared purpose 
                    of escapism and entertainment, are recognized across nearly all cultures, making them a powerful symbol. 
                    Drawing inspiration from the traditional circus tent, the structure is composed of a series of portal frames that allow 
                    for large, unobstructed spans. The evolution from moment frames to portal frames in a radial motion creates a rigid 
                    structure through its configuration and forms an internal courtyard. <br><br> Passive and active systems are integrated into the 
                    building’s form through stormwater management, natural lighting, and the overall geometry of each bay, which reflects 
                    the acoustical qualities required for learning, training, and performance spaces.</p>
