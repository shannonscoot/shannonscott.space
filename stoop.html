                <h2>Bronzeville Stoop</h2>
                <p>An ownership-based housing model focused on the individual dwelling while remaining deeply
                connected to the whole community. The project is supported by youth-focused amenities and 
                locally rooted services. The objective of the project is to support society’s most vulnerable 
                members—children—while serving the current residents of Bronzeville and encouraging the growth 
                of families within the neighborhood. As young families increasingly leave the city for the 
                suburbs, they become disconnected from urban life, weakening community continuity. 
                <br><br>By diversifying age groups and housing typologies, the project aims to create a more 
                resilient and sustainable neighborhood fabric. The development integrates flexible community 
                spaces, daycare, an internet café, a grocery store, and locally owned businesses that support 
                everyday life while strengthening the neighborhood’s economic ecosystem. These businesses honor 
                the deep-rooted history of Bronzeville and the rich legacy of African American entrepreneurship 
                and community resilience. <br><br> At its core, the project fosters a sense of ownership and 
                collective investment in the community. As large-scale rental developments continue to encroach 
                on the area, this proposal introduces diverse housing typologies that allow a broader range of 
                residents to remain and thrive. While the transit-oriented location leverages proximity to the 
                Green Line, the inclusion of neighborhood-scaled retail and small businesses reinforces 
                Bronzeville’s historic identity as a center of local enterprise and self-determination.</p>
